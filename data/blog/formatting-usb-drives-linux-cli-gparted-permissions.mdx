# Formatting a USB Drive

There are two methods to format a USB drive: using the Terminal or using GParted. Here are the steps for each method:

## Method 1: Format USB using the Terminal

1. Identify the USB drive's device name by running the command `lsblk`. The output will show all the connected storage devices, and you can identify the USB drive by its size and mount point.

2. Unmount the USB drive using the command `sudo umount /dev/sdX`, where `sdX` is the device name of the USB drive (e.g., `sdb`, `sdc`).

3. Format the USB drive using one of the following commands, depending on the desired file system:

   - For FAT32: `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX`
   - For NTFS: `sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdX`
   - For EXT4: `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX`

   Replace `sdX` with the appropriate device name.

4. Once the formatting is complete, you can mount the USB drive and start using it. In order to set the correct permissions for the user, follow these steps:
   - Create a mount point: `sudo mkdir /media/usb`
   - Mount the USB drive: `sudo mount /dev/sdX /media/usb`, where `sdX` is the device name.
   - Set the ownership and permissions: `sudo chown -R username:groupname /media/usb`, where `username` and `groupname` are your user account and group.
   - Set read, write, and execute permissions for the user: `sudo chmod -R 700 /media/usb`

## Method 2: Format USB using GParted

1. Install GParted if it is not already installed:

   - Ubuntu and Debian: `sudo apt install gparted`
   - RHEL and CentOS: `sudo yum install gparted`
   - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S gparted`

2. Launch GParted and select the USB drive from the drop-down menu in the top-right corner.

3. Right-click on the partition table of the USB drive and select "Format to". Choose the desired file system (e.g., FAT32, NTFS, EXT4).

4. Click on the green checkmark in the top menu and then click "Apply" to format the USB drive.

After formatting the USB drive using either method, you can follow the steps mentioned in the "Method 1" section to set the correct permissions for the user.
