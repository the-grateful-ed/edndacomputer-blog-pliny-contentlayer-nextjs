## Introduction

Oh-My-Zsh is a popular ZSH framework which includes a series of sensible configurations, helpful aliases, and pretty themes. However, it can be quite heavy and its plugin architecture might not be as well-designed as one would like. To gain more control over your setup with minimum config, you can use Antigen, a plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Pathogen, which is a plugin manager for Vim [^phuctm97.com^].

## Setting up Oh-My-Zsh with Antigen

To set up Oh-My-Zsh with Antigen, first, you need to add `antigen use oh-my-zsh` to your `~/.antigenrc` file. Then, you can enable Oh-My-Zsh plugins and themes by adding the following lines to your `~/.antigenrc` file [^phuctm97.com^]:

```
# Turn on an Oh my Zsh plugin
antigen bundle plugin-name
antigen bundle git
antigen bundle command-not-found
antigen bundle docker

# Apply an Oh my Zsh theme
antigen theme theme-name
antigen theme robbyrussell
```

Refer to the following links for a full list of Oh-My-Zsh plugins and themes:

- [Oh-My-Zsh Themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)

## Adding the NVM Plugin

To add the NVM plugin for switching Node.js versions, you can use the following lines in your `~/.antigenrc` file [^medium.com^]:

```
# NVM bundle
export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true
antigen bundle lukechilds/zsh-nvm
antigen bundle Sparragus/zsh-auto-nvm-use
```

This configuration enables the NVM plugin with lazy loading, which improves startup time.

## Other Useful Plugins

Here are some other useful plugins that you can add to your `~/.antigenrc` file [^medium.com^]:

```
antigen bundle git
antigen bundle heroku
antigen bundle pip
antigen bundle lein
antigen bundle command-not-found
antigen bundle autojump
antigen bundle common-aliases
antigen bundle compleat
antigen bundle git-extras
antigen bundle git-flow
antigen bundle npm
antigen bundle web-search
antigen bundle z
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search ./zsh-history-substring-search.zsh
```

Remember to run `antigen apply` after adding new plugins to your `~/.antigenrc` file.

## Conclusion

Using Antigen with Oh-My-Zsh allows you to have more control over your ZSH setup while maintaining the benefits of the Oh-My-Zsh framework. With the NVM plugin and other useful plugins, you can easily customize your command line experience and improve your productivity.
